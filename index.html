      <h3>Nonprofit Website Build</h3>
      <p class="fade-in">January 2025 – May 2025</p>
      <p class="fade-in"> <br>
I led the end-to-end website revamp for The Chemist Club, and as the team lead, I served as a liaison between the client, organizer, and our team. I translated requirements from the client into functional specifications and managed weekly client meetings to ensure alignment on project milestones. Our team produced site maps, wireframes, and mockups. Post-launch, our web design resulted in more member sign-ups, helping the nonprofit improve user experience.</p>

      <h3>IBM Case Competition</h3>
       <p class="fade-in">October 2024 – December 2024</p>
       <br>
      <p class="fade-in">My team developed an AI-powered solution using IBM WatsonX to address food accessibility challenges affecting over 17 million residents. Recognizing that many food desert programs rely on outdated census data, we focused on utilizing real-time data models to provide more accurate information. We also conducted interviews with residents to translate real-world pain points into a product concept and a year long community support plan for identified food deserts. Our models were prototyped using Tableau maps that visualized severe food desert locations for better resource allocation.</p>

      <h3>E-Commerce Merchandise Store</h3>
             <p class="fade-in">March 2024</p>
             <br>
      <p class="fade-in"> I developed an e-commerce merchandise platform with a focus on data modeling and user experience. I designed and implemented a relational database using SQL to support product, order, and customer data. I used business process models to initially show the purpose of the website. To enhance the customer journey, I created UX designs in Figma, emphasizing the navigation and checkout flows. This project strengthened my ability to connect backend data systems with front-end user experiences.</p>

      <h3>Calendar Auto-Populate Feature</h3>
      <p class="fade-in">September 2025</p>
      <br>
      <p class="fade-in"> I built an AI-assisted productivity feature that extracts assignment deadlines from syllabus PDFs and automatically populates the user's calendar. The solution reduced manual data entry time and significantly minimized errors. This project was started due to an identified problem of missed assignments or exams, simply due to entering dates incorrectly. </p>

      <br>
      <p class="fade-in">I developed and evaluated machine learning models in Google Colab to create a prediction engine aimed at improving decision-making for Airbnb users. The project involved data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.</p>

      <p class="fade-in">I designed this website to help showcase some of my projects, experience, and skills. The site emphasizes clean UI/UX and responsive design. I loved experimenting with ways I can make my site more "animated" and clean. This project reflects my interest in building products and managing projects.</p>
